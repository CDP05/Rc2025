						<h3 class="oliven-story-title">Randy's Pov</h3>
						<p>
							We met in the most unexpected yet divine ways after a NUPS-G Sunday service, surrounded by familiar 
							faces and new conversations. She introduced herself with a name that stopped me in my tracks. 
							It sounded strangely familiar. Not just familiar – painful. You see, it was the name of a soccer 
							player who had scored a gut-wrenching goal against my beloved childhood club in a cup final. 
							One of those “sit on the floor in disbelief” kind of moments. As it turns out, the villain of
							 that memory was her dad. And just like that, I was introduced to the daughter of the man,
							  although loved by many in the sporting world, who was responsible for one of my earliest
							   sporting heartbreaks. I remember laughing to myself, thinking, God must have a sense of
							    humor and, apparently, he did have a beautiful love story in mind.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our relationship started as two people who shared mutual friends, and over time, circumstances 
							brought us closer as friends. The more we communicated and vibed, the more I was amazed by her
							 personality, genuineness, and intelligence. Eventually, I decided that I wanted to be more
							  than just a friend; I wanted a future Mrs. Ackah. I wish this transition was as straightforward 
							  as it seems. When I asked her out, I had to be really patient to get any form of response.
							   Then came the almost moment. She said yes. And the next day… she called back with a hesitant heart.
							    “I’m not so sure,” she said. And honestly, that pause made sense. Real love isn’t rushed.
								 It’s thought over, prayed through, and when she came back around, she did so with peace.
						</p>
						<p>
							Chris, as she’s now known in my circle (thanks to me!), and I have always been friends first. 
							The kind of friends who could talk about scripture for hours. The kind of friend who cheered 
							me through deadlines and exams, who kept me accountable – not just academically but spiritually.
							 We’ve grown together, prayed together, and have constantly seen something deeper and deeper forming.
						</p>
						<p>Ours has also been a long-distance love. At one point, we were on different continents, with a six-hour
							 difference in our time zones. Our schedules never lined up, but somehow, our hearts always did. There
							  were several nights I would sacrifice sleep so we could have conversations, and there were nights when 
							  her beautiful voice wasn’t enough to keep me awake. Over the years, we have prayed for and celebrated 
							  each other's growth and accomplishments. There’s something sacred about cheering for someone when you 
							  can’t physically be there. It’s taught me to listen better, to be more patient, and to keep showing up
							   in more ways than one.
						</p>
						<p>Through it all, God has been at the center—our compass, our confidence, and our calm. We’ve seen each other 
							grow in ways that only time and prayer can reveal. We’ve held space for doubts, encouraged dreams, and built
							 a bond founded not just on love, but on faith, grace, and a shared purpose. From a post-church introduction 
							 to a cross-country friendship, to love that spans time zones and late-night phone calls. Our story isn’t perfect, 
							 but it’s beautifully ours. And I can’t wait for this next chapter, hopefully with a little less distance and with 
							 a shared last name.
						 </p>

						<p>
							Kofi and I met back in my college days through a mutual friend. We also happened to fellowship
							 together at the National Union of Presbyterian Students (NUPS-G). To this day, 
							 I still wonder how he found his way into the drama and dance wing of the church—especially
							  because, truth be told, he’s not exactly a great dancer (sorry, love!). But I suppose it was 
							  all driven by his passion for the things of God.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sweet K, as I affectionately call him, is intelligent, wise, full of warmth, and has a heart that 
							genuinely loves everyone. From the way I’m describing him, I’m sure you can already guess why he 
							stole my heart!
						</p>
						<p>
							Fast forward to a moment in my undergraduate years—I was going through a personal matter, something of the
							 heart. It was during this time that my dearest friend, the Holy Spirit, must have decided it was time to
							  draw Kofi closer to me.
						</p>
						<p> As time went on, our bond grew stronger. He wasn’t just there to listen to my rants or share in my joys and 
							sorrows—he stood by me and offered wise counsel. And how did I know he had more than friendship on his mind?
							 Let’s just say—only God knows how long he stood outside my landlord Mr. Ameyaw’s house, waiting just to catch 
							 a glimpse of me after work. From bringing me foodstuff from his field trips to the many sweet, thoughtful gestures.
							  The things we do for love, indeed.
						</p>
						<p>Still, Kofi remained in the “friendship” category, until the Holy Spirit gently nudged my heart toward him.
						 </p>

						 <p>Guess what? It’s been over four beautiful years since we decided to take that bold step from friendship into something more. 
							These years have been a journey—of learning to be better for each other, growing, forgiving, loving, and holding tightly to
							 the promises of God together. I could go on and on.
						</p>
						<p>I truly cannot imagine doing life with anyone else but you, my Sweet K. My heart is full of excitement for all that God has in 
							store for us. So yes—yes, a thousand times—I said yes to a lifetime with the love of my life
						</p>

										To Christabel and Randy,

I couldn’t be happier for the both of you two amazing people who truly deserve each other (in the best possible way). 
Christabel, you are one of the most selfless and thoughtful souls I’ve ever known. Your kindness is like a warm blanket 
on a cold day except, Roaches can’t say same😂. I thank you for your thoughtfulness and love over the years. I’m grateful
 to God for making me cross paths with you. I love you and wish you all the best in this journey. Fine girl wey love Jesus,
  very intelligent and kind at heart. What more could Randy ask for. Cheers to many amazing years ahead.

And Randy… Randy, you are great. Really. You just need to stop worrying me! I say this with love, of course — you’re the kind
 of guy who cares deeply, and it shows. Just remember that Christabel’s got you, and you’ve got this. I admire how much you love
  Christabel. I have to come for some lessons at some point 😊.

I wish you both nothing but joy, adventure, and all the good things life has to offer — from spontaneous road trips and shared 
inside jokes, to peace, prosperity, and pancakes on Sunday mornings. Lol maybe Fufu or kenkey will do for Christabel.

Here’s to a lifetime of love, laughter, and never running out of snacks or patience. You’re perfect together — and I’m lucky to 
call you both my friends.
Mic 🎤 Drop.

With all my heart,
<b>Standard AJ🥰</b>

										Christabel and I met during my first year at university, and from that moment on, 
										she has been a constant source of support and friendship in my life. Christabel is
										 truly a destiny helper, always there to lend a hand and offer guidance.

She is a remarkable person, calm and composed on the outside, yet fierce and determined on the inside. Her kindness and willingness 
to help others are qualities I admire deeply. Christabel is one of the most selfless individuals I know, always ready to share opportunities 
and uplift those around her.

I truly believe that our friendship was divinely orchestrated, and I am grateful for every moment we have shared. As she embarks on this new 
chapter of her life, I pray that God continues to bless her abundantly, making her life as beautiful as she is. May she find joy and fulfilment 
in her marital journey.

Christabel, I love you so much and am honoured to stand by your side today. Cheers to a lifetime of happiness and love!

										From our days as course mates in undergrad to life in the U.S., I’ve had the
										 honor of calling Randy a brother and friend for over 10 years. In 2017, during 
										 our 3rd year, Randy met Christabel, his fellow church member, who soon became the
										  love of his life. Their bond, built on faith, friendship, and shared values, has
										   grown beautifully ever since. It’s a joy to see a man I’ve known so well step into
										    this beautiful new chapter with her. I couldn’t be happier to witness this union.

										To the Beautiful Couple,I first met Randy during my time as a Teaching 
										Assistant at KNUST. From the very beginning, his outgoing nature and genuine 
										spirit stood out, and it didn’t take long for us to become friends. Over the past 
										eight years, that friendship has grown into a bond that has stood the test of time, 
										distance, and life’s many challenges—both in Ghana and during our journeys here in the U.S.
He has been more than a friend—he’s been a brother, a confidant, and a source of wisdom during some of my most trying moments.
 I have seen his character, his faith, and his unwavering commitment to those he loves. A great friend, a solid Christian, and 
 a truly good man.
Now, as he steps into this new and beautiful season of marriage, I can confidently say he has found a good thing, just as the Bible 
promises. I have no doubt that he and his amazing wife are perfect for each other—two kindred souls walking into a future designed by God.
I wish them a marriage full of understanding, joy, and divine blessings. May God be at the center of everything they build together.
 You are both lucky to have found one another, and even luckier to have chosen each other.
Congratulations, and may your journey together be nothing short of beautiful.
Warmly,
<b>Kelvin.</b>
